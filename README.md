Issues
------
If you come across something that seems like a bug, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Make sure you are using the latest Release version of ACCollector-Server. If the error is occurring on [*INSERT PUBLIC INSTANCE URI HERE*] then this is true.
* Make sure this is actually a bug with the server software. If you are not sure, report the bug in the [client repository](https://github.com/Drakmyth/ACCollector-Client) instead.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.
* If you have a crash report, please include that too by copying it into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and including the link. Just dumping a crash report directly into your report will cause your report to be closed without review.

Feature Requests
----------------
Have an idea for a new API or some other feature that would fit well in this software? Awesome! File an issue and detail your idea. Keep it succinct and on-point, and only one feature per request, or it'll get closed as "Invalid". Then we'll discuss your idea some and decide whether to implement it or not.

Contributions
-------------
This software is open source! That means if you'd like to try your hand at fixing a bug or implementing a feature, please do so! Head over to the Issues page and look for any open issues tagged with the "Accepted" label. Create a branch, work on it, then submit a pull request. We'll work together to iron out any concerns with your code, and then we'll merge it in and your code will become a part of ACCollector's legacy!
